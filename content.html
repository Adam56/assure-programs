						<h2 id="isi-start"><strong>Indication</strong> and <strong>Important Safety Information</strong> for Abilify&nbsp;Maintena.</h2>
						<p><strong><b>Indication: </b></strong>Abilify&nbsp;Maintena is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p>
						<h3><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></h3>
						<h4>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h4>
						<p><b>Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Abilify&nbsp;Maintena is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.</b></p>
					</div> <!-- /#sticky -->
					<div class="below">
						<p><b>Contraindication:</b> Known hypersensitivity reaction to Abilify&nbsp;Maintena. Reactions have ranged from pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis.</p>
						<p><b>Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke:</b> Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (eg, stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, have been reported in clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with Abilify&nbsp;Maintena.</p>
						<p><b>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):</b> A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as NMS has been reported. Signs and symptoms of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).</p>
						<p><b>Tardive Dyskinesia (TD):</b> The risk of developing TD, abnormal involuntary movements, has been associated with administered antipsychotic drugs. Counsel patients to notify their physician if they notice any movements which they cannot control in their face, tongue, or other body part.</p>
						<p><b>Metabolic Changes:</b> Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus:</b> Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with Abilify&nbsp;Maintena. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those that develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment.</li>
							<li><b>Dyslipidemia:</b> Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed. There were no significant differences between Abilify&nbsp;Maintena - and placebo-treated patients in the proportion with changes from normal to clinically significant levels for fasting/nonfasting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting LDLs, and fasting/nonfasting HDLs.</li>
							<li><b>Weight Gain:</b> Weight gain has been observed. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Orthostatic Hypotension:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abilify&nbsp;Maintena should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose them to hypotension.</p> 
						<p><b>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis:</b> Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC count or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their CBC monitored while receiving Abilify&nbsp;Maintena.</p>
						<p><b>Seizures/Convulsions:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abilify&nbsp;Maintena should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold (eg, Alzheimer's dementia).</p> 
						<p><b>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment:</b> Abilify&nbsp;Maintena may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should not drive or operate hazardous machinery until they are certain Abilify&nbsp;Maintena does not affect them adversely.</p>
						<p><b>Heat Exposure and Dehydration:</b> Advise patients regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration.</p>
						<p><b>Dysphagia:</b> Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with Abilify&nbsp;Maintena; use caution in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia.</p>
						<p><b>Alcohol:</b> Physicians should advise patients to avoid alcohol while taking Abilify&nbsp;Maintena.</p>
						<p><b>Concomitant Medication:</b> Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors for greater than 14 days. If the CYP3A4 inhibitor or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn, the Abilify&nbsp;Maintena dosage may need to be increased <i>[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</i>. Avoid the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with Abilify&nbsp;Maintena for greater than 14 days because the blood levels of aripiprazole are decreased and may be below the effective levels. Dosage adjustments are not recommended for patients with concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers for less than 14 days.</p>
						<p><b>Most commonly observed adverse reaction</b> (&ge;5% incidence and at least twice the rate of placebo for oral aripiprazole vs. placebo, respectively):</p>
						<p class="bullet">Adult patients with schizophrenia: akathisia (8% vs 4%)</p>
						<p>Dystonia is a class effect of antipsychotic drugs. Symptoms of dystonia may occur in susceptible individuals during the first days of treatment and at low doses.</p>
						<p><b>Pregnancy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. Abilify&nbsp;Maintena should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Aripiprazole is excreted in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

						    <p>This website is administered by Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. (OAPI), the distributor and marketer of Abilify&nbsp;Maintena&trade;&nbsp;(aripiprazole). OAPI co-promotes Abilify&nbsp;Maintena with Lundbeck. We want you to feel secure when visiting our site and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so.</p>
						    <p>The following provides an overview of how we protect your privacy during your visit.</p>
						    <h6>What information do we gather?</h6>
						    <p>Information on AbilifyMaintena.com is gathered in two ways: (1)&nbsp;indirectly (for example, through our site's technology); and (2)&nbsp;directly (for example, when you provide information on various pages of AbilifyMaintena.com). One example of information we collect indirectly is through our Internet access logs. When you access AbilifyMaintena.com, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs.</p> 
						    <p>We collect information directly from you in a number of ways, some of which we describe in this Privacy Policy. One way is through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information which save and retrieve information about your visit to AbilifyMaintena.com&mdash;for example, how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. (If you are uncomfortable regarding cookies use, please keep in mind you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser.) We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. Our site may provide opportunities to contact us to ask questions or provide comments, ideas and/or suggestions. When you communicate with us and request a response, we may ask for your name and contact information. If we collect this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for it and how this information will be used. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it.</p>
						    <h6>How do we use this information?</h6>
						    <p>We analyze the information to determine what is most effective about our site, to help us identify ways to improve it, and eventually, to determine how we can tailor AbilifyMaintena.com to make it more effective. We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information.</p>
						    <h6>Will we share this with outside parties?</h6>
						    <p>As a global organization, data we collect may be transferred internationally throughout our worldwide organization. We will not sell individual information and will share it only with our affiliates and consultants as needed. There may be other times when we need to share information; however, before you submit any information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for it and it is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it.</p>
						    <h6>What about sensitive personal data?</h6>
						    <p>We do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal data through this site. If we do seek to collect such data, we will ask you to consent to our proposed uses of the data. We may also collect some sensitive personal data incidentally. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law as described in this Privacy Policy. The references to "sensitive personal data" are to the various categories of personal data identified by U.S., European and other data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent. These categories comprise personal identity numbers; personal data about personality and private life; racial or ethnic origin; nationality; political opinions; membership in political parties or movements; religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs; membership in a trade union or profession or trade association; physical or mental health; genetic code; addictions; sexual life; property matters; or criminal record (including information about suspected criminal activities).</p>
						    <h6>Do we give you access to your information?</h6>
						    <p>You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do, to have access to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. You can do this by <a href="mailto:&#099;&#111;&#114;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#097;&#116;&#101;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;&#109;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#099;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#064;&#111;&#116;&#115;&#117;&#107;&#097;&#045;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">sending us an email</a>.</p>
						    <h6>What about data security?</h6>
						    <p>We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of your data on AbilifyMaintena.com.
